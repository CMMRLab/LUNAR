The DEV_Tools folder is a folder for storing the "unpolished"
python codes and miscellaneous projects that pertain to the
entire distribution. Therefore it is up the recipients of 
this package to make sense of the "unpolished" work found
in this directory. Josh is including it because he sees the
work in DEV_Tools to be useful for those who would like to
further develop the distribution or adjust things.
