* Overview *
************

  LUNAR/auto_morse_bond_update.py is meant to convert an IFF parameterized LAMMPS datafile to an IFF-R parameterized file. This is a quick
  guide to the auto_morse_bond_update.py module. More details can be found in the official manual found in the LUNAR/docs folder. 

**********
* Inputs *
**********

  topofile   
    Button to load in a file defining 
    
  parent_directory
    Button to load in a path to the directory where the outputs will be written to. You may also directly type the path in the entry to the
    right of the button as well. The path can be a full path or relative path or be set to the . (dot character) to write files to the location
    where auto_morse_bond_update.py is currently being run from. Setting parent_directory to "topofile" will use the path of the topofile
    variable to write the files to that location on your machine. The "topofile" shortcut string should be the default usage for 1st time users.

  newfile
    An entry to supply a string that will be used to set the output files basename. The following options exist for using the newfile string for
    setting the output file basename: 
      
      if newfile starts with ':' or ends with ':'
        The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s), but will have a suffix or prefix added to the file basename. The
        following are examples:
          Suffix (newfile == ':_typed'  and topofile == 'detda.data')
            basename = 'detda_typed', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.
          Prefix (newfile == 'typed-:'  and topofile == 'detda.data')
            basename = 'typed-detda', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.
        Recommended usage: common and safe as this method is safe and output filename(s) carry similar names to input filename(s).
		
      if newfile == 'ANYTEXT'
        The output filename(s) will be set as 'ANYTEXT'. For example:
          newfile = 'detda_renamed' and topofile = 'detda.data'
          basename = 'detda_renamed'
        Recommended usage: occasional and safe as output filename(s) no longer carry similar names as output filename(s), but is safe as output
        filename(s) will not overwrite input filename(s).
      
      if newfile == '':
        The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s). This can be a dangerous option as you may inadvertently overwrite a
        file and then may assume the file to contain certain information, but it contains other information. Recommended usage: rare and
        dangerous as this could lead to using incorrect files if not paying attention very carefully.

* Buttons *
***********

  Run LUNAR/auto_morse_bond_update.py
    A button to run the auto_morse_bond_update.py to set the atom types of a molecular system, using all settings defined in the GUI.
	
  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in auto_morse_bond_update.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the
    auto_morse_bond_update.py file. Thus this button creates a method to update the auto_morse_bond_update.py file. The CLI also initializes
    its defaults from the variables in the auto_morse_bond_update.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally,
    running auto_morse_bond_update.py from an IDE, the defaults for IDE usage are also set by the variables in the auto_morse_bond_update.py
    file, thus this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
