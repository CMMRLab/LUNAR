* Overview *
************

  LUNAR/auto_morse_bond_update.py is meant to convert an IFF parameterized LAMMPS datafile to an IFF-R parameterized file. This is a quick
  guide to the auto_morse_bond_update.py module. More details can be found in the official manual found in the LUNAR/docs folder. 

**********
* Inputs *
**********

  topofile   
    Button to load in a LAMMPS datafile to convert from IFF to IFF-R. The bond coefficients must either be in "class2" or "harmonic" format. 
	
  morsefile
    Button to load in a file that contains the bond typing rules and bond dissociation energies for each bond type.    
	
  parent_directory
    Button to load in a path to the directory where the outputs will be written to. You may also directly type the path in the entry to the
    right of the button as well. The path can be a full path or relative path or be set to the . (dot character) to write files to the location
    where auto_morse_bond_update.py is currently being run from. Setting parent_directory to "topofile" will use the path of the topofile
    variable to write the files to that location on your machine. The "topofile" shortcut string should be the default usage for 1st time users.

  newfile
    An entry to supply a string that will be used to set the output files basename. The following options exist for using the newfile string for
    setting the output file basename: 
      
      if newfile starts with ':' or ends with ':'
        The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s), but will have a suffix or prefix added to the file basename. The
        following are examples:
          Suffix (newfile == ':_morse'  and topofile == 'detda.data')
            basename = 'detda_morse', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.
          Prefix (newfile == 'morse-:'  and topofile == 'detda.data')
            basename = 'morse-detda', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.
        Recommended usage: common and safe as this method is safe and output filename(s) carry similar names to input filename(s).
		
      if newfile == 'ANYTEXT'
        The output filename(s) will be set as 'ANYTEXT'. For example:
          newfile = 'detda_renamed' and topofile = 'detda.data'
          basename = 'detda_renamed'
        Recommended usage: occasional and safe as output filename(s) no longer carry similar names as output filename(s), but is safe as output
        filename(s) will not overwrite input filename(s).
      
      if newfile == '':
        The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s). This can be a dangerous option as you may inadvertently overwrite a
        file and then may assume the file to contain certain information, but it contains other information. Recommended usage: rare and
        dangerous as this could lead to using incorrect files if not paying attention very carefully.
		
  Bond CoeffIDs 2 skip
    An entry to type any bond coefficient integer identifiers to skip when updating harmonic bonds to Morse bonds. The entry is comma-separated
    with no white spaces. For a harmonic bond to be updated to a Morse bond the bond equilibrium length must also be greater than the
    min_bond_length entry.

***********
* Options *
***********

  ff_class
    A drop-down menu to select the type of force field that is being read-in via the frc_file entry. Currently supported force field types and
    their definitions:
        1 = class1 (CVFF, CVFF-IFF, Clay-FF)
        2 = class2 (PCFF, PCFF-IFF, COMPASS)
		
  atom_style
    A drop-down menu to select the format of the Atoms section that will be written in the outputted LAMMPS datafile. auto_morse_bond_update.py
    supports many LAMMPS atom styles, however if the information for the atom style does not exist in the read-in frc_file, the code will insert
    ZERO's and will WARN the user of doing so. In general for fix-bond force fields the full atom style is recomended and for ReaxFF the charge
    atom style is recomended.
	
  zero_effected_xterms
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to zero any crossterms in class2 force field files that use bond length to compute their interactions
    (bondbond, bondangle, middlebondtorsion, endbondtorsion, and bondbond13). If the Boolean is True the crossterm stiffness values will be
    zeroed, making them none operative and if False, the crossterm stiffness values will be left alone.
  
  include_type_labels
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to include LAMMPS TypeLabels in the written LAMMPS datafile If the Boolean is True TypeLabels will be
    written in files, if the Boolean is False the written files will use the standard LAMMPS TypeIDs.
	
  include_rcut
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to include a rcut value in the Morse bond coefficients, which allows for the shifting of the Morse
    bond to create near zero energy discontinuity once a bond is broken. This Morse bond shifting has been shown to help stabilize systems when
    using "fix bond/break" using the "fix temp/csvr", canonical sampling thermostat. The standard Morse bond parameters layout is described below
    and will result from setting include_rcut as False, which is compatible with the standard LAMMPS Morse bond potential.
      Bond Coeffs  # morse
      1  morse      D  r0  alpha 
	  
    If include_rcut is True, the Morse bond parameters layout is described below and is only compatible if you compile LAMMPS with the
    USER-MORSE/active/bond_morse.cpp and USER-MORSE/active/bond_morse.h files.
      Bond Coeffs  # morse
      1  morse      D  r0  alpha  rcut
    Where the rcut value will shift the Morse bonding potential as shown in dark blue below and rcut is controlled by the r0 and bondbreak_scale
    via rcut = r0*bondbreak_scale.
	
  min_bond_length
    An entry to supply a float value that sets the minimum bond length to update a harmonic bond to a Morse bond. This option can be used in
    conjunction with Bond CoeffIDs 2 skip to control which bonds are updated to Morse bonds.
	
  bond_break_scale
    An entry to supply float value to serve as a multiplier value to the equilibrium r0value of each bondTypeID. The purpose of bondbreak_scale
    is to adjust the rcut value in the LAMMPS include the file that auto_morse_bond_update.py can write if files2write write_bondbreak is True,
    which auto-generates "fix bond/break" commands with rcut = r0*bondbreak_scale. The r0*bondbreak_scale is consistent with how IFF-R has been
    defined to be used with the "fix bond/break" command, where the default range of bondbreak_scale is 1.75-2.0.

*****************************
* Plot/Alphas2check Options *
*****************************

  plot start radius
    An entry to supply float value to set the starting value for plotting the fit Morse bond potential (almost always should be zero).
	
  plot end radius
    An entry to supply float value to set the ending value for plotting the fit Morse bond potential (almost always should be 8.0).
	
  plot radius increment
    An entry to supply float value to set the increment of the radius data (almost always should be 0.01).
	
  smallest alpha
    An entry to supply float value to the lower bound for alpha parameters (almost always should be 1.0).
	
  largest alpha
    An entry to supply float value to the upper bound for alpha parameters (almost always should be 3.5).
	
  alpha increment
    An entry to supply float value to set the increment of the alpha values to fit (almost always should be 0.1).
	
***********************
* Files2write Options *
***********************

  write_datafile
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to write a LAMMPS datafile with new Morse bonds defined and possible modifications of any
    crossterms in class2 force fields depending on zero_effected_xterms Boolean option.
	
  write_pdffile
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to write .pdf file of all fit Morse bond potentials around the harmonic bond potential.
	
  write_bondbreak
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to write LAMMPS "include" type of file with "fix bond/break" commands set based on bondbreak_scale
    and include_rcut Boolean options.
	
***********
* Buttons *
***********

  Run LUNAR/auto_morse_bond_update.py
    A button to run the auto_morse_bond_update.py to convert harmonic bonds to morse bonds, using all settings defined in the GUI.
	
  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in auto_morse_bond_update.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the
    auto_morse_bond_update.py file. Thus this button creates a method to update the auto_morse_bond_update.py file. The CLI also initializes
    its defaults from the variables in the auto_morse_bond_update.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally,
    running auto_morse_bond_update.py from an IDE, the defaults for IDE usage are also set by the variables in the auto_morse_bond_update.py
    file, thus this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
