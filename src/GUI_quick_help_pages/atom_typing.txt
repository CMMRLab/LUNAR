* Overview *
************

  LUNAR/atom_typing.py is meant to assign force field specific atom types to a molecular system. This is a quick guide to the atom_typing.py
  module. More details can be found in the official manual found in the LUNAR/docs folder. 

**********
* Inputs *
**********

  topofile   
    Button to load in a file defining atomic positions and bonding connectivity. You may also directly type the filename in the entry to the
    right of the button as well. The supported file extensions are:
      .data  or  .mol  or  .mol2  or  .sdf  or  .pdf  or  .smiles
    Using the .smiles extension requires rdkit to be installed where you may supply a SMILES string as CCC1=CC(=C(C(=C1N)C)N)CC.smiles, which
    will generate the atomic positions using rdkit and assign atom types.
	  
  bondfile
    Button to load in a file created using the LAMMPS command "fix reaxff/bonds". When pairing this with a LAMMPS datafile from a ReaxFF
    simulation, a ReaxFF model may be converted to a fix-bond force field. All time series of bond orders will be averaged together and the bond
    order cutoff values are defined via the bondorder dictionary found in atom_typing.py. Additionally, a maximum number of bonded atoms per
    element type is also enforced when finding bonds from a ReaxFF bond order file, which is controlled by the maxbonded dictionary in
    atom_typing.py.

    If your system already has bonds defined you may set the bondfile entry to n.u. (not used).
    
  parent_directory
    Button to load in a path to the directory where the outputs will be written to. You may also directly type the path in the entry to the
    right of the button as well. The path can be a full path or relative path or be set to the . (dot character) to write files to the location
    where atom_typing.py is currently being run from. Setting parent_directory to "topofile" will use the path of the topofile variable to write
    the files to that location on your machine. The "topofile" shortcut string should be the default usage for 1st time users.

  chargefile	
    Button to load in a file defining the parameters to use for the Gasteiger charging method. You may also directly type the filename in the
    entry to the right of the button as well. Please note that to use the Gasteiger charging method, reset_charges must be set to True.

  include_comments_nta
    A dropdown menu to select a Boolean (True or False) to either write comments (True) to the new type assignment file or to not write comments
    in the new type assignment file (False). During atom typing the code will set comments for each atom (most of the time the comments are
    "Correctly found", but may differ depending on how the atom type was assigned). If you plan to manually edit the atom types or add the
    atomtype:NAME to the atom type the comments can quickly ruin the readability of the file. Please refer to the all2lmp.py chapter in the
    manual for the atomtype:NAME option. 
	
  newfile
    An entry to supply a string that will be used to set the output files basename. The following options exist for using the newfile string for
    setting the output file basename: 
      
      if newfile starts with ':' or ends with ':'
        The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s), but will have a suffix or prefix added to the file basename. The
        following are examples:
          Suffix (newfile == ':_typed'  and topofile == 'detda.data')
            basename = 'detda_typed', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.
          Prefix (newfile == 'typed-:'  and topofile == 'detda.data')
            basename = 'typed-detda', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.
        Recommended usage: common and safe as this method is safe and output filename(s) carry similar names to input filename(s).
		
      if newfile == 'ANYTEXT'
        The output filename(s) will be set as 'ANYTEXT'. For example:
          newfile = 'detda_renamed' and topofile = 'detda.data'
          basename = 'detda_renamed'
        Recommended usage: occasional and safe as output filename(s) no longer carry similar names as output filename(s), but is safe as output
        filename(s) will not overwrite input filename(s).
      
      if newfile == '':
        The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s). This can be a dangerous option as you may inadvertently overwrite a
        file and then may assume the file to contain certain information, but it contains other information. Recommended usage: rare and
        dangerous as this could lead to using incorrect files if not paying attention very carefully.

***********
* Options *
***********

  ff_name
    A drop-down menu to select the type of force field atom types to apply to the molecular system.
	
  reset_charges
    A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to reset partial atomic charges or not. If the Boolean is True all atomic partial charges will be
    reset using the Gasteiger charging method (with Gasteiger parameters defined in the chargefile), if the Boolean is False the partial atomic
    charges will remain as the charges that are read into atom_typing.py. For chemical file formats that do not support charge information (such
    as .mol), the charges are initialized as zeros when reading the file. If using the Gasteiger charging method, the charge will be written in
    the outputted LAMMPS datafile that will then be passed onto all2lmp.py to apply a given force field. This means to maintain the Gasteiger
    charging you will need to set the reset_charge Boolean in all2lmp.py to False, so all2lmp.py will use the Gasteiger charges that will be
    read into all2lmp.py.
	
  delete_atoms['method']
    A drop-down menu to select how atom clusters are identified to be removed from the system. Two methods are currently supported and are
    described below:
      mass = will identify clusters based on mass
      size = will identify clusters based on the number of atoms
	  
  delete_atoms['criteria']
    The float value specified in delete_atoms['criteria'] will then be the upper cutoff, where any molecule mass or size smaller (set by
    delete_atoms['method']) than the critierai will be removed from the system. If 'criteria' is set as zero the atomIDs from the input files
    will remain consistent with the atomIDs of the output files (hence no renaming of the atomIDs will occur even if the atomIDs are not
    contiguous). If 'criteria' is set to something larger than zero, atomIDs will be reset to be contiguous, even if no groups of atoms are
    removed.
	
  pdb_file
    A drop-down menu to select the options to have atom_typing.py write a .pdb file. This option primarily exists to provide methods to interface
    with packmol, but may also be found to be useful outside of interfacing with packmol. Please review the "Packmol interfacing section" in the
    "Work flows and Use Cases" chapter of the manual found in the LUNAR/docs directory for further explanations on interfacing methods. The
    following options are described below:
      skip     will not write additional *_packmol.pdb and *_packmol.nta files
      types    will write additional *_packmol.pdb file but not *_packmol.nta, with the atom types set in the atom name.
      typeIDs  will write additional *_packmol.pdb and *_packmol.nta files, with atomTypeIDs set in the atom name column of the .pdb file and
               atom types set in the .nta file using the "style type" method.
			   
************************
* Bond finding options *
************************

  The bond finding options section of the atom_typing.py module will usually not need to be used. However, in some cases, it may be desired to
  reset the bonds in a molecular system. The most obvious case is if VMD or Avogadro was used to create either a graphene sheet a graphite system
  or a CNT, where both VMD and Avogadro will not provide periodic bonds linking the edge of one side to the other. The settings described below
  will allow users to override the bonds data structure in atom_typing.py with newly created bonds based on periodic boundary flags and van der
  Waal radius scale variable to increase or decrease the maximum cutoff distances used to find new bonds. Please see the "VMD interfacing with
  CNT and graphite builders" in the "Workflows and Use Cases" section of the official LUNAR manual found in LUNAR/docs directory for further
  details and examples.
  
  vdw_radius_scale
    A float value to increase or decrease the van der Waal radius values. The van der Waal radius cutoff values of two atoms are summed together
    to use as a cutoff value for the maximum distance the two atoms can be apart. If the two atoms' distances are less than the sum of the scaled
    van der Waals radius, then they are considered to be bonded atoms, if the distances are greater they are considered to be not bonded atoms. A
    vdw radius scale of 0.8 means a decrease in the maximum distance by 20% and a vdw radius scale of 1.2 means an increase in the maximum
    distance scale by 20%. A good default radius scale is around 1.1.
	
  boundary
    A string value with three characters with whitespace between them. This option sets the boundary of the simulation cell to use when computing
    bonds via interatomic distance searching with bond length cutoffs set based on the vdw_radius_scale variable. The following characters are
    supported:
      p is periodic
      f is non-periodic and fixed
    The characters are based on LAMMPS syntax and each location in the string sets the x, y, or z faces of the simulation cell to that boundary.
	
  bonds_via_distance_override
    A dropdown menu to select the Boolean to redefine system bonds via interatomic distance searches and bond length cutoffs. By default
    atom_typing.py will use the bonds in the read-in file, therefore to redefine bonds the bonds_via_distance_override Boolean must be set
    to True.
	
***********
* Buttons *
***********

  Run LUNAR/atom_typing.py
    A button to run the atom_typing.py to set the atom types of a molecular system, using all settings defined in the GUI.
	
  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in atom_typing.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the atom_typing.py file.
    Thus this button creates a method to update the atom_typing.py file. The CLI also initializes its defaults from the variables in the
    atom_typing.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally, running atom_typing.py from an IDE, the defaults for
    IDE usage are also set by the variables in the atom_typing.py file, thus this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
