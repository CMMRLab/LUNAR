* Overview *
************

  LUNAR/sheet_builder.py is meant to build sheets or tubes of sp2 hybridized atoms. The outputs are meant to be passed onto LUNAR/all2lmp.py
  to build a fully parameterized LAMMPS datafile or if find_bonds = False, the LUNAR/sheet_builder.py outputted LAMMPS datafile can directly
  be used for a ReaxFF simulation in LAMMPS.

* Global Inputs *
*****************
            
  parent_directory
    Button to load in a path to the directory where the outputs will be written to. You may also directly type the path in the entry to the 
    right of the button as well. The path can be a full path or relative path or be set to the . (dot character) to write files to the
    location where sheet_builder.py is currently being run from.
	
  type1 and type2 and type3 and type4
    Drop down menu to supply a string that will assign an atom type or element in a specfic location of the ring. This will allow users to control the
    "pattern" of atoms for generating sheets or tubes that contain multiple atom types or elements (for example in Boron-Nitride sheets or
    tubes). The "base unit" that is replicated to generate the sheets or tubes is describe in the figure below:

    The drop down menu will set the atom type or element to repeat in the "pattern". Note that if you would like to generate a sheet or tube
    with different atom types or elements then are currently in the drop down menu, you may do so by deleting the entry (or selecting the blank
    entry) and typing the specifc atom type or element combination in manually). An .nta file will be written such that the outputs of this code
    can be read into LUNAR/all2lmp.py to assign a specifc force field to the atomic positions generated. Thus the strings in the Drop down menu 
    should be set to the force field specfic atom types that you plan to apply using LUNAR/all2lmp.py. Here are a few examples for different force
    fields for a carbon system:                                                                          
      PCFF     -> types = {1:'cp',  2:'cp',  3:'cp',  4:'cp'}                                                 
      PCFF-IFF -> types = {1:'cg1', 2:'cg1', 3:'cg1', 4:'cg1'}                                                
      DREIDING -> types = {1:'C_R', 2:'C_R', 3:'C_R', 4:'C_R'}                                                
      ReaxFF   -> types = {1:'C',   2:'C',   3:'C',   4:'C'}                                                  
    NOTE: that when generating inputs to ReaxFF that you set the actually element symbol and not classical force field atom types. Also note that
    when generating inputs to ReaxFF, you should set find_bonds as False which will allow you to directly take the output LAMMPS datafile of this
    code and run in a LAMMPS ReaxFF simulation.   

    Additionaly IFF's pi-electrons can be added to a system by setting each type as 'atomtype|pi-electron' where the '|' character seperates the
    atomtype from the pi-electron type. For example:                     
                                                                                                            
        types = {1:'cg1|cge', 2:'cg1|cge', 3:'cg1|cge', 4:'cg1|cge'} will generate:

    Final note, is that in the "sheet_builder.py" file, there is a charge dictionary, which is used to store the charge for each atom type that
    may appear in the type1 - type4 drop down menus. Thus the only way to adjust charge is to open the "sheet_builder.py" file and manually
    adjust the charge dictionary.	                                        	
	
  bond_length
    An entry to control the in-plane spacing of atoms when generating sheets or tubes based on the bond length between atoms. The bond length is
    supplied in units of Angstroms (usually around 1.42 A).
	
  find_bonds
     A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to control whether or not to find bonds based on interatomic distance searching. If find_bonds is
     True, bonds will be found via interatomic distance searching and bonds will be written in the output LAMMPS datafile. If find_bonds is False
     no bonds will be found and no bonds will be written in the output LAMMPS datafile. When finding bonds the bonds can be set to be periodic or
     non-periodic, see the periodic_bonds flag. NOTE find_bonds must be True to generate an outputted .nta file.
	 
  periodic_bonds
     A drop-down menu to select the Boolean to control whether bonds will pass through the periodic boundary or not. If the Boolean is True, when
     bonds are determined via interatomic distances, bonds will be found that pass through a periodic boundary. If the Boolean is False no
     periodic bonds will be found.

                 direction set by the "edge length" entry.

    A drop-down menu to set how sheets are stacked if "nlayers" is greater than one. The following stacking sequences are available:
      'AA'
      'AB'

    Entries to control the size of the tube. The "tube length" entry controls the length of the tube in the axial direction and "tube diameter"
    controls the diameter of the tube.
	
  layer spacing
    An entry to control the out-of-plane spacing of atoms when multiple tubes are added (i.e. when ntubes is greater then 1). The layer spacing
    is supplied in units of Angstroms (usually around 3.354 A).
	
  ntubes
    An entry to control the number of tubes to generate. All models will be centered about (0, 0, 0) no matter the number of tubes generated.
    When ntubes is greater then 1, the "diameter" entry will control the inner most tube diameter and the N-outer layer tube diameters will be
    controlled by the "ntubes" and "layer spacing" entries.
	
  edge type
    A drop-down menu to set the edge type of the tube. The available edge types are:
      'armchair' which will generate a tube with the "circumference" being in the armchair direction         
      'zigzag'   which will generate a tube with the "circumference" being in the zigzag direction 

  axis	
    A drop-down menu to set which axis the tube axis is aligned with.

  basename
    An entry to set output basename of outputs for when running in 'chiral-tube' mode.
	
  tube length
    An entry to control the length of a chiral tube. NOTE the chiral indices "m" and "n" control the "base-tube" length where the "tube length"
    sets the desired length of a chiral tube, where the "base-tube" will be replicated enough times to get a tube close in length to "tube
    length".
	
  n and m
    Entries to control the chiral indices of n and m. All physical properties of a chiral single wall tube depend on the chiral indices.
    Symmetric tubes can be generated when:
      m = n, which generates an armchair tube                                                                 
      m = 0, which generates a zigzag tube   
    If it is desired to create armchair or zigzag tubes this code can be ran in mode = 'symmetric-tube', which provides easier control over the
    tube length and diameter. The 'symmetric-tube' mode also allows multiwall nanotubes to be generated with easy. Thus it is recommend only to
    use the 'chiral-tube' mode if you want to generate a chiral tube and use the 'symmetric-tube' to generate tubes in either armchair or zigzag      
    configurations.

  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in sheet_builder.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the
    sheet_builder.py file. Thus this button creates a method to update the sheet_builder.py file. The CLI also initializes its
    defaults from the variables in the sheet_builder.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally,
    running sheet_builder.py from an IDE, the defaults for IDE usage are also set by the variables in the sheet_builder.py file,
    thus this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
