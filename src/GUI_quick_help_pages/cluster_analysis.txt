* Overview *
************

  LUNAR/cluster_analysis.py is meant to analyze a polymer/system bonding connectivity/network and report the following metrics:
    Clusters from 1-to-N clusters in the systems where the following metrics are computed for each bonded cluster:
      Number of atoms (size)
      Percent number of atoms (% size)
      Mass (in AMU)
      Percent Mass (% mass)
    Extent of reaction (p)
    Critical extent of reaction (pg)
    Degree of Polymerization (Xn)
    Weight-average molar mass (Mw)
    Number-average molar mass (Mn)
    Higher-average molar mass (Mz)
    Higher-average molar mass (Mz+1)
    Weight-average reduced molar mass (RMW)

* Inputs *
**********

  topofile   
    Button to load in a LAMMPS datafile analyze the bonding connectivity. You may also directly type the filename in the entry to the right
    of the button as well.
	
  N0 and fav
    Entries to set N0 and fav values which are used to compute the following metrics:
      Extent of reaction: p = (2*(N0-N))/(N0*fav)
      Critical extent of reaction: pg = 2/fav
      Degree of Polymerization: Xn = 2/(2-p*fav)
      Where:
        p is the extent of reaction
        pg is the critical extent of reaction
        N0 Number of initial molecules before polymerization
        N is the number of clusters in the current LAMMPS datafile
        fav is the average number of functional groups present per monomer unit  
        Xn is the degree of polymerization  
	
  txtfile
    A drop-down menu to select a Boolean variable (True or False) to write a .txt file to log the printouts of the code.

* Buttons *
***********

  Run LUNAR/cluster_analysis.py
    A button to run the cluster_analysis.py to analyze bonding connectivity, using all settings defined in the GUI.
	
  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in cluster_analysis.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the
    cluster_analysis.py file. Thus this button creates a method to update the cluster_analysis.py file. The CLI also initializes its
    defaults from the variables in the cluster_analysis.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally, running
    cluster_analysis.py from an IDE, the defaults for IDE usage are also set by the variables in the cluster_analysis.py file, thus
    this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
