* Overview *
************

  LUNAR/lmp2SYBYLmol2.py is meant to to have a tool to convert any LAMMPS datafile to a SYBYL .mol2 format such that chemical drawing
  or visualization tools such as ChemDraw, Avogadro, VMD, Material Studio, etc may be used open, view and/or modify a LAMMPS simulated molecule
  or system. The intended usage case is to either visualize a molecule/system or to be able to draw in or remove atoms using tools such as
  ChemDraw, Avogadro, VMD, Material Studio, etc. Creating a loop of processing within LUNAR where the sequence would be atom_typing.py ->
  all2lmp.py -> LAMMPS simulation -> lmp2SYBYLmol2.py -> chemical drawing software -> atom_typing.py, for an arbitrary number of cycles.

* Inputs *
**********

  topofile   
    Button to load in a LAMMPS datafile to convert to a .mol2 file. You may also directly type
    the filename in the entry to the right of the button as well.
            
  parent_directory
    Button to load in a path to the directory where the outputs will be written to. You may also directly type the path in the entry to the 
    right of the button as well. The path can be a full path or relative path or be set to the . (dot character) to write files to the
    location where bond_react_merge.py is currently being run from. Setting parent_directory to "topofile" will use the path of the topofile
    variable to write the files to that location on your machine. The "topofile" shortcut string should be the default usage for 1st time users.

  rm_PBC_bonds
    A drop-down menu to select a Boolean to remove periodic bonds or not remove periodic bonds, where these bonds are determined to be periodic
    via the minimum image convention. If the intended use is to visualize a molecule system in tools such as ChemDraw, Avogadro, VMD, Material
    Studio, etc it may be desired to remove the periodic bonds, which will appear as long bonds spanning the system.

* Buttons *

  Run LUNAR/lmp2SYBYLmol2.py
    A button to run the lmp2SYBYLmol2.py to merge all parameters of mutliple molecular systems, using all settings defined in the GUI.
	
  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in lmp2SYBYLmol2.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the
    lmp2SYBYLmol2.py file. Thus this button creates a method to update the lmp2SYBYLmol2.py file. The CLI also initializes its
    defaults from the variables in the lmp2SYBYLmol2.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally, running
    lmp2SYBYLmol2.py from an IDE, the defaults for IDE usage are also set by the variables in the lmp2SYBYLmol2.py file, thus
    this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
