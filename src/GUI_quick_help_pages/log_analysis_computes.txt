* Compute options *
*******************

  The X-data and Y-data drop down menus in the "Data2load" section allows for the ability to set the X-data and Y-data to plot based on the
  column names in the loaded LAMMPS logfile. However it is sometimes desirable to be able to perform further calculations on the column data
  from the LAMMPS logfile. These compute options allows for new X-data and Y-data to be computed prior to plotting and analyzing the X-data
  and the Y-data.
  
  The computes using the column data names from the LAMMPS logfile is setup similar to how you may reference a variable in LAMMPS, where you
  "wrap" the variable in between "${" and "}" characters. For example say you wanted to scale the "Step" data you can put
    ${Steps}*(1/1000)
  in either the X-compute or Y-compute entry. This will inform the code to perform vectorized multiplication for every data point in the Step
  column data, by 1/1000. If the X-data dropdown menu contains a column name and the X-compute entry contains a compute, the compute will be
  used over the X-data column name. Similarly if the Y-data dropdown menu contains a column name and the Y-compute entry contains a compute,
  the compute will be used over the Y-data column name.
  
******************
* Math operators *
******************

  The basic math operators are supported for these vectorized computes. See below for a map of syntax to the math operation:
    The "+" character is used for addition. For example:
      ${Step} + 100

    The "-" character is used for subtraction. For example:
      ${Step} - 100	
  
    The "*" character is used for multiplication. For example:
      ${Step}*100
		
    The "/" character is used for division. For example:
      ${Step}/100
		
    The "**N" character is used to raise something to the power N. For example:
      ${Step}**2
      ${Step}**(1/2)

* Examples of some useful computes *
************************************

  Say we want to convert the "Temp" column from Kelvin to Celsius, you can set a compute like:
    ${Temp} - 273.15
	
  Say we want to convert the "Temp" column from Kelvin to Fahrenheit, you can set a compute like:
    (${Temp} - 273.15)*(9/5) + 32
	
  Say we want to convert the "Press" column from atm to PSI, you can set a compute like:
    ${Press}*14.696
	
  Say we want to convert the "Volume" column from angstrom^3 to specific volume, you can set a compute like:
    1/${Volume}
	
  Say we wanted to compute von mises stress from LAMMPS variables, you can set a compute like:
    (((${f_sxx}-${f_syy})**2 + (${f_syy}-${f_szz})**2 + (${f_szz}-${f_sxx})**2 + 6*(${f_sxy}**2 + ${f_syz}**2 + ${f_sxz}**2))/2)**0.5
