* Overview *
************
  LUNAR/auto_cluster_analysis.py is meant to analyze "large batches" of LAMMPS datafiles by loading in a directory of LAMMPS datafiles iterating
  through the directory automatically and then storing the outputs (user-defined based on some small amount of Python coding) in a .csv file.
  This can reduce the tedious process of analyzing "large batches" of LAMMPS datafiles with cluster_analysis.py however customizing the output
  .csv file format requires a small amount of Python code manipulation. The default values written to the .csv files are enough to compute the
  gel point of polymerization simulation, but others may be added if the users desire them. The following metrics can be reported in the .csv file
    Clusters from 1-to-N clusters in the systems where the following metrics are computed for each bonded cluster:
      Number of atoms (size)
      Percent number of atoms (% size)
      Mass (in AMU)
      Percent Mass (% mass)
    Extent of reaction (p)
    Critical extent of reaction (pg)
    Degree of Polymerization (Xn)
    Weight-average molar mass (Mw)
    Number-average molar mass (Mn)
    Higher-average molar mass (Mz)
    Higher-average molar mass (Mz+1)
    Weight-average reduced molar mass (RMW)

* Inputs *
**********

  files_directory  
    Button to set the files directory to load in all the LAMMPS datafiles in the directory and analyze the bonding connectivity. You may also
    directly type the files directory name to the right of the button as well.
	
  N0 and fav
    Entries to set N0 and fav values which are used to compute the following metrics:
      Extent of reaction: p = (2*(N0-N))/(N0*fav)
      Critical extent of reaction: pg = 2/fav
      Degree of Polymerization: Xn = 2/(2-p*fav)
      Where:
        p is the extent of reaction
        pg is the critical extent of reaction
        N0 Number of initial molecules before polymerization
        N is the number of clusters in the current LAMMPS datafile
        fav is the average number of functional groups present per monomer unit  
        Xn is the degree of polymerization  
	
  txtfile
    A drop-down menu to select a Boolean variable (True or False) to write a .txt file to log the printouts of the code.

* Buttons *
***********

  Run LUNAR/cluster_analysis.py
    A button to run the cluster_analysis.py to analyze bonding connectivity, using all settings defined in the GUI.
	
  Save the current GUI settings as the default GUI settings
    A button to update variables in cluster_analysis.py file. Each time the GUI is launched all GUI settings are loaded from the
    cluster_analysis.py file. Thus this button creates a method to update the cluster_analysis.py file. The CLI also initializes its
    defaults from the variables in the cluster_analysis.py, so this button updates the defaults for that run mode as well. Finally, running
    cluster_analysis.py from an IDE, the defaults for IDE usage are also set by the variables in the cluster_analysis.py file, thus
    this button will also update the defaults for IDE usage.
    
  Quick help
    A button to create a popup for quick help and guidance.
