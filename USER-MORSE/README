Holds tested additional pieces of code for the abovementioned version of
LAMMPS.

20210114	- Creation date
		- Addition of pair_style lj, lj/morse, and lj/morse/coul/long

PJV, 20210114


Installing package
------------------

  make yes-user-morse
  make machine

where machine stands for the target machine.


Added functionality
-------------------

Pair styles:

pair_style	lj	cutoff
pair_coeff	i	j	A	B	[cutoff]

pair_style	lj/morse	cutoff
pair_coeff	i	j	A	B	d0	alpha	r0	[cutoff]

pair_style	lj/morse/coul/long
pair_coeff	i	j	A	B	d0	alpha	r0	[cutoff]

where

E_LJ		= A/r^12 - B/r^6
E_Morse		= d0 * ((exp(-alpha*(r-r0)) - 1.0)^2.0 - 1.0)

Please note, that all interaction coefficients need to be provided due to absence of mixing rules.  Only pair_style lj/morse/coul/long supports RESPA.
