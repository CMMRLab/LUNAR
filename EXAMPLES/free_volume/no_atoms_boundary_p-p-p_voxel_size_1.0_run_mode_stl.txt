Percent Free volume   : 100.0 %


Fractional Free Volume for polymers (FFV = Vf/Vsp; where Vf = Vsp - Voc & Voc = 1.3*Vw) results:
Van der Waals Volume (Vw)        : 0.0 cm^3
Occupied Volume (Voc)            : 0 cm^3/g
Specfic Volume (Vsp)             : 0 cm^3/g
Fractional Free volume (100*FFV) : 0 (%)

  If you are using this metric it should be for polymers ONLY and FFV should be positive. If FFV is negative
  you should use the "Percent Free Volume" instead. Addtionally you should cite the following:

  It is also recommend to read up on the FFV definiton, its limitations/critiques. A link is provided to get
  started in your search (https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-662-44324-8_243#citeas).
  Typical FFV for polymers is in the range of 10-25%, however some polymers such as polytrimethylsilyl propyne
  may have FFV as large as 35%.
