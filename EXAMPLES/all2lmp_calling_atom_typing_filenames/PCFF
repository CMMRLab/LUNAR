This is a blank file with the name 'PCFF' to 
click on when using the nta_file button of all2lmp.py
to automatically load in the name 'PCFF' into
all2lmp.py to enforce usage of 'PCFF' atom types
by calling atom_typing with the ff_name set as
'PCFF'.

NOTE that the all2lmp.py GUI will load this 
file with a path. The path will be stripped
by all2lmp.py to get the filename only.
