Sp2  Nitrogen FAILED to be found with search criteria of ring size, number of connects, and connected elements.
Most likely cause is that DREIDING doesnt have an atom type for this application and assumed atom type was put in its place.
You may go into the ouputted *.nta file and give this atom type a different type if you would like.
