cp in types2convert was found to be a string, and maps to atomTypeID 1 in VMD_graphite_typed_IFF_pi_electrons.data
add_pi_electrons and reset_charge were both True. Setting reset_charge = False, since add_pi_electrons will adjust charge.
Converting coeffs to cg1.
Adding pi electrons and updating coeffs/charges. Created:

Resetting simulation cell dimensions after adding pi-electrons.
Zeroing system net charge by adding a fixed value to atoms that DO NOT belong to the following types: 1 2 3.
WARNING net_zero_charge could not be enforced since all atoms are defined by the atom types in types2convert = 1 2 3. System charge = 0.0
