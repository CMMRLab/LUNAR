# This file supports optional comment characters of "#", where anything following the
# "#" character is ignored by the code. This file contains a file format that will be
# read in and parsed into a python dictionary for bond_react_merge.py. The file tags 
# should follow the same rules that are listed in bond_react_merge.py, where each file
# tag is unique and each filename is unqiue. The available file tags are:
#    * data1, data2, ... dataN for an arbitrary amount of starting molecules
#    * pre1, pre2, ... preN for an arbitrary amount of pre rxns
#    * post1, post2, ... postN for an arbitrary amount of post rxns
#    * NOTE: if generate_map_file the N-ID assigned between preN/postN MUST BE CONSISTENT!!!!
# Example files section:
# file-tag    filename
# data1       example_molecule1.data
# data2       example_molecule2.data
# pre1        example_pre-rxn1.data
# post1       example_post-rxn1.data
# 
# An optional path keyword maybe set as path=directory-path, where directory path will be appended
# to the front of the file names. Path examples:
# path=""     (will not append any path to the filename)
# path="testing/inputs/"  (the path testing/inputs/ will be appended to all the filenames)
#
# *NOTE: the path variable will be able to traverse deeper into a file structure and by 
# specifing more unqiue path in the path="" quotations, but can also reduce the depth
# by using ../ characters like the ../ terminal command*
#
# An optional parent_directory keyword maybe set to update the parent_directory to
# variable inside bond_react_merge.py to have the input file set the parent_directory.
# Examples:
# parent_directory="" (will not set parent_directory)
# parent_directory="testing/inputs/merged" (files will be written to testing/inputs/merged directory)



# Specify a desired path to append to the front of each filename
# Will append EXAMPLES/bond_react_merge_tests/test11 to the begining of all filenames
path="EXAMPLES/bond_react_merge_tests/test11" 

# file-tag   filename                                    comment  
  data1      detda_typed_IFF_tag=data1.data           # This datafile will have all coeffs in it
  data2      dgeba_typed_IFF_tag=data2.data           # This datafile will have all coeffs in it
  pre1       pre_reaction_1_typed_IFF_tag=pre1.data   # for rxn1
  post1      post_reaction_1_typed_IFF_tag=post1.data # for rxn1
  pre2       pre_reaction_2_typed_IFF_tag=pre2.data   # for rxn2
  post2      post_reaction_2_typed_IFF_tag=post2.data # for rxn2


# Specify the parent_directory of where to write results to
parent_directory = "topofile/run"
