Using Python version 3.12.7 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct  4 2024, 13:17:27) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]
Read in EXAMPLES/sheet_builder/Grafting_PCFF-IFF_full_test/sheet_typed_IFF.data LAMMPS datafile
cp in types2convert was found to be a string, and maps to atomTypeID 3 in sheet_typed_IFF_pi_electrons.data
add_pi_electrons and reset_charge were both True. Setting reset_charge = False, since add_pi_electrons will adjust charge.
Converting coeffs to cg1.
