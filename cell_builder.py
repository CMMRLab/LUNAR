# Python boolean variable to use GUI or not (True or False). All GUI settings are intialized from this script #
# so adjusting this script will set the default settings that the GUI will load with. Please NOTE that when   #
# using the GUI to check the console or terminal print outs every time a system is run through the code       #
# because that is where the import information will be displayed. Examples:                                   #
#   use_GUI = True  # Will launch GUI to manipulate variables and run from GUI                                #
#   use_GUI = False # Will NOT launch GUI where to manipulate variables and run will have to be from the      #
#                     IDE or command line                                                                     #
#                                                                                                             #
# Python variable to set the maxfiles the GUI will load with (maxfiles must be an integer value). Please NOTE #
# that the GUI supports file overloading when running, so maxfiles only sets the intial number of files and   #
# more will be dynamically added if more files are provide while the GUI is loaded. Examples:                 #
#   maxfiles = 4 # GUI will load with 4 files slots and the GUI will automatically add more when "overloaded" #
#   maxfiles = 8 # GUI will load with 8 files slots and the GUI will automatically add more when "overloaded" #
#                                                                                                             #
# Python boolean variable (True or False) to set if the GUI will will have a horizontal scroll bar or not,    #
# since it is conceivable that a large number of files could create a GUI that requires more screen space     #
# then what your computer has can offer. Where the scroll bar can then be a handy thing to have on the GUI.   #
# The current implementation of the scroll bar sometimes requires the user to "Maximize" the GUI and then     #
# "Collapse" the GUI again to allow the scroll bar to scroll the entire GUI. This is determined to be a       #
# Tkinter issue (the modules used to build the GUIs) and is likely very little that can be done to address    #
# that type of behavior. In light of this the scroll bar option has been given a boolean to use (True) or not #
# to use (False). Examples:                                                                                   #
#   scroll_bar = True  # GUI will have scroll bar to scroll GUI and the GUI size will be "locked"             #
#   scroll_bar = False # GUI will NOT have scroll bar to scroll GUI and the GUI size will be be able to "grow"#
#                                                                                                             #
# Python int value to range from 0 to 200 to control the GUI zoom. Where it option was added to account for   #
# the different ways individuals have their OS display settings setup. A GUI_zoom = 100, means that default   #
# settings are used, whereas a GUI_zoom = 120 means increase GUI size by 20% and GUI_zoom = 80 means decrease #
# GUI by 20%. Examples:                                                                                       #
#   GUI_zoom = 100 # use default GUI size                                                                     #
#   GUI_zoom = 75  # decrease GUI size by 25%                                                                 #

# Python float variable to set the size of each subcell that a molecule will be placed in. Each subcell       #
# dimension is set that it may hold the largest molecule from the read-in files in any orientation without    #
# passing the subcell dimensions. This is to avoid running molecules into other molecules when applying random#
# rotations. distance_scale sets a multiplier value to increase or decrease (at your own risk) the dimension  #
# of each subcell and ultimately the spacing of all molecules. Examples:                                      #
#     distance_scale = 1.0 # Each subcell is the minimum size to hold the largest molecule in th read-in files#
#     distance_scale = 1.2 # Each subcell is 20% larger then required and will space molecules apart more.    #
#     distance_scale = 0.8 # Each subcell is 20% smaller then required and will reduce the space between      #
#                            molecules (may create overlapped atoms). If max_rotations are set to ZEROES all  #
#                            molecules will keep the same orientation and thus can be "packed" together with  #
#                            a reduced risk of overlapping atoms and likely is the only case where you would  #
#                            set this less then 1.0.                                                          #

# *NOTE: sometimes setting distance_scale to 1.0 may still cause molecules to have very high intial energies  #
# that may cause LAMMPS to crash with a "Out of range atoms" ERROR. If this happens, increase the distance    #
# scale variable to ensure that the intial energy of the system are not large during the first few timesteps. #

# The random option will be used of domain = 'LxA x LyA x LzA' or domain = 'A x A x A'. What random means is  #
# that the insertion of molecules into a simulation cell is performed randomly. The cell_builder module was   #
# orginally built to insert molecules onto a cubic lattice. However, this results if low density systems that #
# may take awhile to shrink in LAMMPS. The random method allows cell_builder to randomly generate molecule    #
# positions and rotations and then check if that molecule overlaps with any atoms in the current system. The  #
# max density the random method can usually generate is less then 0.5 gm/cm^3 and attempting to generate any  #
# system denser may cause cell_builder to run for very long period of times. The following variables control  #
# the random insertion of molecules:                                                                          #

#        Which is a Python int variable to control the number of times to try to randomly insert a molecule   #
#        into a system. After each insertion of a molecule, the next insertion becomes even more difficult    #
#        as, the simulation cell is getting denser with each insertaion. Examples:                            #
#            maxtry = 1000 # try inserting each molecule 1000 times                                           #

#        Which is a Python string variable to control how Pair Coeff LJ parameters are mixed if the tolerance #
#        variable is an <int>. The following strings are supported:                                           #
#            'tolerance'   which means the tolerance variable is a <float> and to use the float variable to   #
#                          check for atom overlaps. This option maybe needed for ReaxFF model generation, as  #
#                          there are no Pair Coeffs in a ReaxFF LAMMPS datafile.                              #
#            'geometric'   which means mix the i,j LJ parameters using geometric mixing rules (FFs like       #
#                          DREIDING).                                                                         #
#            'arithmetic'  which means mix the i,j LJ parameters using arithmetic mixing rules (FFs like      #
#                          CHARMM).                                                                           #
#            'sixthpower'  which means mix the i,j LJ parameters using sixthpower mixing rules (FFs like      #
#                          PCFF).                                                                             #
#            '-min'        NOTE: the '-min' ending can be appended to 'geometric' or 'arithmetic' or          #
#                          'sixthpower' to create 'geometric-min' or 'arithmetic-min' or 'sixthpower-min',    #
#                          which will multiply the mixed LJ-sigma values by 2^(1/6) for 'geometric' and       #
#                          'arithmetic'or 1.5^(1/3) for 'sixthpower' to set the overlap condition to place    #
#                          molecules with vdw energy at the LJ-minimum.                                       #
#         The 'sixthpower' mixing rule is the most 'conservative' as it generates the largest mixed LJ sigma  #
#         parameters and thus can ensure no overlapped atoms not matter what mixing rule ends up being        #
#         applied in LAMMPS. Thus the 'sixthpower' mixing rule can be a good default. Examples:               #
#             mixing_rule = 'tolerance'  # will user tolerance <float> to model all atom diameters the same.  #
#             mixing_rule = 'sixthpower' # will combine LJ parameters using the sixthpower mixing rule to     #
#                                        # model all atom diameters like in an MD simulation.                 #
#                                                                                                             #

#        Which is a Python int or float varaible which controls how to check for overlaps in atoms during     #
#        molecule insertion. If it is in int or float, it effects how to check for overlaps as follows:       #
#            tolerance = <float>, which means all atom diameters will be modeled as that <float> input        #
#                                 provided.                                                                   #
#            tolerance = <int>,   which sets the index of the sigma value in the LAMMPS Pair Coeff section    #
#                                 of the LAMMPS datafile. For example Pair Coeffs are read from the LAMMPS    #

#        Which is a Python string variable to control the boundary of the simulation cell, when inserting     #
#        molecules. The boundary variable is set up like the LAMMPS "boundary" command, where three flags     #
#        are provided to set the x, y, or z boundary of the simulation cell. The flags are like LAMMPS flags: #
#            p is periodic                                                                                    #
#            f is non-periodic and fixed                                                                      #
#        When the boundary is 'p p p' or full periodic, each image of each atom is checked, thus checking for #
#        overlaps is more computationaly intensive. However allowing molecules to span the simulation cell    #
#        "opens" more space to possible insert the molecule. This ultimately seems to make the code run time  #
#        quicker when inserting molecules into a dense system as compared to a boundary of 'f f f' or a non   #
#        periodic system. Examples:                                                                           #

# Is a Python string variable with the following options and their meanings:                                  #
#	'skip'     will use the molIDs set in the files that are read in. If the file format supplied to          #
#              cell_builder.py does not have molIDs, every atom molID will default to one.                    #
#                                                                                                             #
#	'files'    will set molIDs based on the order the files are read into cell_builder.py, where every atom   #
#              in the first file will be assigned to molID one, every atom in the second file will be assigned#
#              to molID two and so on.                                                                        #
#                                                                                                             #
#   'offset'   will offset the molIDs in each file as each file is read in. If every atoms molID are the same #
#              in each file the 'offset' method and the 'files' method will create the same result. If the    #
#              file contains different molIDs on different atoms and you wish to maintain the distinction,    #
#              the offset is the method to use.                                                               #
#                                                                                                             #
#	'clusters' will perform a cluster analysis, where the "clusters" of atoms are determined via bonding      #
#              connectivity, where the criteria for atoms to be part of the same "cluster" is that the atoms  #
#              must be linked by at least one covalent bond to the cluster. The clusters are then sorted by   #
#              the number of atoms, where the largest number of atoms is identified as cluster one, then      #
#              molIDs are incremented and are assigned to each of the remaining clusters (i.e., the largest   #
#              cluster of atoms will have molID 1, and then the smallest cluster will have a molID of         #
#              NCLUSTERS found).                                                                              #
#                                                                                                             #
#   str(int)   where str(int) means you supply and integer in string format (i.e. '1', '2', '3'). When this   #
#              method is used, all atoms that will be added to the system will be assigned this molID. This   #
#              can be useful for easy grouping when "combining" files in LAMMPS as you can control the molIDs #
#              from this step.                                                                                #
#                                                                                                             #
# Depending on the different analysis and/or visualization the different reset_molid options may be useful,   #
# since they can be used to identity groups of atoms, which can be tedious depending on the type of modeling  #
# that is being used. Examples:                                                                               #
#    reset_molids = 'skip'     # every duplicated atom will maintain the molID in the read in file            #
#    reset_molids = 'files'    # every atom in each file will be assigned to a unique molID                   #
#    reset_molids = 'offset'   # each time a file is read the molIDs will be offset incrementally             #
#    reset_molids = 'clusters' # molIDs will be consistent with the clusters of atoms                         #
#                                                                                                             #
# Update reset_molids as desired (Default should be 'clusters').                                              #
