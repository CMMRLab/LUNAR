Joshs NOTES on the .frc files:
    Note that some of the .frc files in this folder have come from
	msi2lmp that is found in the tools folder of the LAMMPS distribution.
	However, Josh has also added to following .frc files:
		- all2lmp_dreiding.frc (built by Josh from the DREIDING paper)
		- all2lmp_interatomic.frc (built by Josh for all2lmp.py ReaxFF, REBO, AIREBO, SNAP, ... files)
		- all2lmp_oplsaa_tinker (built by Josh from Tinker opls-aa parameters)
		- pcff_interface_v1_5.frc (from IFF website - still need permission)
		- cvff_interface_v1_5.frc (from IFF website - still need permission)
    Additionally, there is a "general_assumed_equivs.coeffs" file, which is
	an example file on using the assumed auto fill option found in all2lmp.py,
	where "general_assumed_equivs.coeffs" is compatable with PCFF/PCFF-IFF.
	
LAMMPS NOTES on the .frc files:
    Note that LAMMPS does not distribute Accelrys (or old BioSym)
    force field files, since they are proprietary.  All the
    files in this directory that are part of the LAMMPS distribution
    are openly available files that are in the public domain.
