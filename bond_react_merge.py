# Python boolean variable to use GUI or not (True or False). All GUI settings are intialized from this script so adjusting  #
# this script will set the default settings that the GUI will load with. Please NOTE that when using the GUI to check the   #
# console or terminal print outs every time a system is run through the code because that is where the import information   #
# will be displayed. Examples:                                                                                              #
#   use_GUI = True  # Will launch GUI to manipulate variables and run from GUI                                              #
#   use_GUI = False # Will NOT launch GUI where to manipulate variables and run will have to be from the IDE or command line#
#                                                                                                                           #
# Python variable to set the maxfiles the GUI will load with (maxfiles must be an integer value). Please NOTE that the GUI  #
# supports file overloading when running, so maxfiles only sets the intial number of files and more will be dynamically     #
# added if more files are provide while the GUI is loaded. Examples:                                                        #
#   maxfiles = 4 # GUI will load with 4 files slots and the GUI will automatically add more when "overloaded"               #
#   maxfiles = 8 # GUI will load with 8 files slots and the GUI will automatically add more when "overloaded"               #
#                                                                                                                           #
# Python boolean variable (True or False) to set if the GUI will will have a horizontal scroll bar or not, since it is      #
# conceivable that a large number of files could create a GUI that requires more screen space then what your computer has   #
# can offer. Where the scroll bar can then be a handy thing to have on the GUI. The current implementation of the scroll bar#
# sometimes requires the user to "Maximize" the GUI and then "Collapse" the GUI again to allow the scroll bar to scroll the #
# entire GUI. This is determined to be a Tkinter issue (the modules used to build the GUIs) and is likely very little that  #
# can be done to address that type of behavior. In light of this the scroll bar option has been given a boolean to use      #
# (True) or not to use (False). Examples:                                                                                   #
#   scroll_bar = True  # GUI will have scroll bar to scroll GUI and the GUI size will be "locked" during initialization     #
#   scroll_bar = False # GUI will NOT have scroll bar to scroll GUI and the GUI size will be be able to "grow"              #
#                                                                                                                           #
# Python int value to range from 0 to 200 to control the GUI zoom. Where it option was added to account for the different   #
# ways individuals have their OS display settings setup. A GUI_zoom = 100, means that default settings are used, whereas a  #
# GUI_zoom = 120 means increase GUI size by 20% and GUI_zoom = 80 means decrease GUI by 20%. Examples:                      #
#   GUI_zoom = 100 # use default GUI size                                                                                   #
#   GUI_zoom = 75  # decrease GUI size by 25%                                                                               #

# The main input to this code is a python dictionary where the keys represent a "file-tag". The key (file-tag) will be what #
# is used to decide what type of final file to write and what type of processing needs to be done. The value of the         #
# dictionary will be a string for calling the LAMMPS datafile you want to read. Rules for formating the files dictionary:   #
# - the key can be any of the following (depending on desired output):                                                      #
#    * data1, data2, ... dataN for an arbitrary amount of starting molecules                                                #
#    * pre1, pre2, ...   preN for an arbitrary amount of pre rxns                                                           #
#    * post1, post2, ... postN for an arbitrary amount of post rxns                                                         #
#    * infile            for reading in input script that specifies file names                                              #
#    * NOTE: if generate_map_file the N-ID assigned between preN/postN MUST BE CONSISTENT!!!!                               #
# - the value MUST a LAMMPS datafile generated by all2lmp or commented by bond_react_merge_prep.py. Alternatively if the    #
#   datafile has type labels generated by all2lmp and has been run through LAMMPS already, the all2lmp style comments will  #
#   by removed, but the src/read_lmp.py code will re-insert the comments based on the type labels that LAMMPS preserves.    #
#   This will make for an easier pre/post/medial processing of merging parameters and generating templates if needed.       #
#   Please ensure the following:                                                                                            #
#    * datafile mapping to the "file-tag" is proper (otherwise files will be written incorrectly)                           #
#    * that the files keys are all unqiue (IE you dont use data1 twice) because python dictionaries can only have a set of  #
#      unqiue keys. Hence the N-ith notation.                                                                               #

# Is a Python string variable in which to set the new output filename(s). The following options exist for using the newfile #
# string for setting the output file basenames:                                                                             #
#                                                                                                                           #
#   if newfile starts with ':' or ends with ':'                                                                             #
#     The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s), but will have a suffix or prefix added to the file  #
#     basename. The following are examples:                                                                                 #
#       Suffix (newfile = ':_merged'  and topofile = 'detda.data')                                                          #
#         basename = 'detda_merged', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.               #
#       Prefix (newfile = 'merged-:'  and topofile = 'detda.data')                                                          #
#         basename = 'merged-detda', where the ':' character acts as a placeholder for the topofile basename.               #
#     Recommended usage: common and safe as this method is safe and output filename(s) carry similar names to input         #
#     filename(s).                                                                                                          #

#     The output filename(s) will be set as the file tag of each file and 'ANYTEXT' will be a suffix appended to the file   #
#     tag. For example:                                                                                                     #
#       newfile = '-merged', topofile = 'detda.data', and tag = 'data1')                                                    #

#     Recommended usage: occasional and safe as output filename(s) no longer carry similar names as output filename(s), but #
#     is safe as output filename(s) will not overwrite input filename(s)                                                    #
#                                                                                                                           #
#   if newfile == ''                                                                                                        #
#     The output filename(s) will be the same as the input filename(s). This can be a dangerous option as you may           #
#     inadvertently overwrite a file and then must assume the file to contain certain information, but it contains other    #
#     information.                                                                                                          #

#      A string that looks like a python variable and a python list. The variable name BondingIDs specifies what this info  #
#      is and must be present for usage of this option! This option is to specify "linking" atomIDs in the pre-rxn template #
#      and the post-rxn template to help the code set equivalances. NOTE that the usage of this option is NOT required and  #
#      the code will still attempt to find the correct mapping without this being specified in the preN tagged file.        #
#      However if BondingIDs are specified it will help ensure the code can find the mapping between the pre and post-rxn   #
#      by using them as starting points for a BFS (Breadth First-Search) traversal, mapping the pre-atomIDs to the          #
#      post-atomIDs at each sequential depth stage emanating from the BondingIDs. Not all rxn templates can use this option #
#      since it assumes minimal topological changes from the pre to the post-rxn, where the "linking" pair can be seen in   #
#      both the pre and post-rxn template. The BondingIDs option is equivalent to that of AutoMapper's --ba option (if you  #
#      are familar), where 4 atomIDs MUST BE specified and the order is important. The first two IDs are the IDs for the    #
#      "linking" atomIDs in the pre-rxn and the second two IDs are for the "linking" atomIDs in the post-rxn template. The  #
#      1st atomID and the 3rd atomID MUST BE equivalences between the pre and post-rxn template and the 2nd atomID and 4th  #
#      atomID MUST BE equivalences between the pre and post-rxn template. To use this option simply put the string of       #
#      BondingIDs = [1, 2, 3, 4], in the header of the corresponding pre-rxn datafile before running bond_react_merge.py.   #

#      A string that looks like a python variable and a python list. The variable name CreateIDs specifies what this info is#
#      and must be present for usage of this option! This option is to specify the atomIDs that are considered to be atoms  #
#      that bond/react can create. These atomIDs are the atomIDs found in the post-rxn template and DO NOT have a map to    #
#      any pre-rxn atomIDs. If the rxn-template has any atomIDs that are being created, THIS MUST APPEAR in the preN tagged #
#      file for that rxn if you want to use the generate_map_file option. If the rxn creates new atomIDs and they are not   #
#      specified by this option and you try to use the generate_map_file option the code will exit with an ERROR saying the #
#      pre-rxn template and post-rxn template DO NOT have the same number of atoms. To use this option simply put the string#

#      preID2 and postID2 must be equivs and depth is the Breadth-First Traversal (DFS) depth of atoms to keep emanating    #

#      preN/postN tagged files, where all atoms in the depth range from ID1 and ID2 are kept. The location in the header    #
#      does not matter for usage of this option. NOTE that ID1 and ID2 need not be "linking" atomIDs but should be near the #
#      "center" of the post-rxn template. Using Reduce with list length of imposes a depth restriction from ID1 and ID2, to #
#      be identical. See coupling of Reduce and BondingIDs to get around the depth restriction.                             #

#      A string that looks like a python variable and a python list. The name Keep can be used to "keep" certain atoms when #

#      atomIDs, which can be used with the Reduce option or a stand alone option, if for some reason you accidentally built #
#      a reaction template with atoms where they should not belong.                                                         #

#      The usage of the Reduce option does not check for ring opening reactions, thus it is up to the user to make sure that#
#      the depth varaible set with the Reduce list of 5 or the depth1 and depth2 variable set with the Reduce list of 2 with#
#      the coupling of BondingIDs is correct for the reaction being modeled. Setting the varaibles  write_rxn_mol2files and #
#      /or write_rxn_datafiles will allow for the visualization of the newly reduced template. In general the depth, depth1,#
#      and depth2 varaible should be large enough to make sure all bonded interations are accounted for (IE if dihedrals and#
#      impropers are being modeled the minimum value of depth or depth1 or depth2 should be 3, which finds neighbors up to  #
#      3 atoms away which is far enough for dihedral and improper interactions. Josh also recommends using the coupling of  #
#      Reduce and BondingIDs when its is able to be used due to the amount of flexibility this option allows. However, it   #
#      may not always be possible to find the "linking" atomIDs that are required for setting BondingIDs at which you can   #
#      default to using the Reduce option with list length of 5 elements. Also note that pairing any of the Reduce options  #
#      with the Keep or Remove option maybe a productive way to use the Reduce option, when dealing w/ a complex reaction.  #
#                                                                                                                           #

#        'custom_charges/depth_from_edge_N' where custom_charges specifies the code to build options for bond/react's       #
#         custom_charges option and depth_from_edge_N tells the code to build a fragmentID that only has atomic charges at  #
#         a certain depth N away from any edge atom. This is useful if the charge method used could not assign a proper     #
#         charge to the edge atoms of the molecule template. This code has another option: map_near_edge_rxn_charges that   #
#         works fairly well to map charges from any dataN or postN tagged files onto edge atoms and a certain depth from    #
#         edge atoms, but this is another workaround to the charging issue of atoms near or edge atoms or edge atoms        #
#         themselves. Much like map_near_edge_rxn_charges the meaning of depth for this option is as follows:               #
#                 0 = preN tagged files will have a molecule file with a fragmentID with all atoms specified EXCEPT edge    #
#                     atoms at depth 0 from any edge.                                                                       #
#                 1 = preN tagged files will have a *.lmpmol molecule template file with a fragmentID with all atoms        #
#                     specified EXCEPT edge atoms at depth 1 from any edge.                                                 #
#                 N = preN tagged files will have a *.lmpmol molecule template file with a fragmentID with all atoms        #
#                     specified EXCEPT edge atoms at depth N from any edge.                                                 #
